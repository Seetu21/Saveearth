  <h1>What is the Amazon Rainforest</h1>
  <img src="https://wallpapertag.com/wallpaper/full/5/7/9/464397-large-amazon-rainforest-wallpaper-1920x1080-mobile.jpg" >
  <p>The Amazon rainforest is a moist broadleaf forest that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7 million square kilometers (2.7 million square miles), of which 5.5 million square kilometers (2.1 million square miles) are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations. The majority of the rainforest is located in Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest's land cover, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, and Suriname with the remaining 17%. 
    <br></br>
    The Amazon represents over half of the world's remaining rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees in about 16,000 species. 
    <br></br>
    More than 30 million people of 350 different ethnic groups live in the Amazon, which are subdivided into 9 different national political systems and 3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories. Indigenous peoples make up 9% of the total population, and 60 of the groups remain largely isolated.
    <br></br>
    The Amazon rainforest is home to an incredible diversity of plants and animals. Scientists estimate that there are millions of species living in the rainforest, many of which have yet to be discovered. Some of the most iconic animals of the Amazon include jaguars, anacondas, caimans, capybaras, macaws, and monkeys. The rainforest is also home to a wide variety of trees, including the Brazil nut tree, the mahogany tree, and the rubber tree.
    <br></br>
    The Amazon rainforest plays a vital role in the global environment. It helps to regulate the Earth's climate, produce oxygen, and absorb carbon dioxide. The rainforest is also a major source of freshwater, with the Amazon River and its tributaries accounting for 20% of the world's liquid freshwater.
    <br></br>
    However, the Amazon rainforest is under threat from deforestation and other human activities. Deforestation is clearing the rainforest for logging, agriculture, and mining. This can have a devastating impact on the rainforest's biodiversity and its ability to function as a natural ecosystem. Other threats to the Amazon rainforest include climate change, pollution, and the introduction of invasive species.
    <br></br>
    It is important to protect the Amazon rainforest for the sake of the planet and its inhabitants. We can all do our part by reducing our consumption of products that are linked to deforestation, such as beef, palm oil, and paper. We can also support organizations that are working to protect the rainforest and its indigenous peoples.
