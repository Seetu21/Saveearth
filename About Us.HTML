  <h1>About us </h1>
  
  <p>I am a 8th grade MYP student from a school called Agakhan academy Hyderabad. I have learnt about the serious issue going on in the Amazon rainforest in 2023 and wanted to make a change and contribute towards trying to help the amazon rainforest. 
    I have done this by creating a suitable website for all types of audience to create awareness on this issue and try and change people.
